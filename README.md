# Harry Potter fan-fiction generator using Markov chain principle
This is a project that uses an ML model base on Markov chain principle, to generate short Harry Potter fan-fictions.
An extract from Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Askaban has been used to train the model.


## Setup

Set up a Python virtual environment using the following command in the root directory:

Windows:

```shell
$ python -m venv venv
$ venv\Scripts\activate
```

Mac / Linux:

```shell
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
```



## Run

To run the fan-fiction generator, run the 'fanfic.py' program on the virtual environment.
